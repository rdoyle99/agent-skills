**Title:** I made agent skills for marketing and sales (not just coding) — free on GitHub

**Body:**

Everyone's building agent skills for React, Next.js, Postgres, etc. Makes sense — that's where most of the developer audience is.

But I kept wishing my AI agent was as good at business stuff as it is at coding. Things like:

- Writing cold emails that don't sound like a robot wrote them
- Analyzing competitors systematically instead of getting a generic SWOT
- Building actual growth strategies based on my company's stage

So I built a set of business-focused agent skills. Three are free on GitHub:

**🎯 Cold Outreach System** — Full B2B prospecting workflow: research framework, personalization tiers, email writing, 5-email follow-up sequences, objection handling, campaign architecture, deliverability checklist.

**🔍 Competitive Intelligence** — Battlecard templates, market maps, feature comparison matrices, pricing analysis, sales enablement messaging, monitoring systems.

**📊 SaaS Growth Playbook** — Stage-appropriate strategy ($0 to $10M+ ARR), channel selection framework, metrics that matter at each stage, experiment prioritization (ICE), pricing quick framework.

Works with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, OpenClaw, or anything that reads SKILL.md files.

Also have a premium bundle with 26 skills covering copywriting, SEO, CRO, email sequences, pricing strategy, launch strategy, paid ads, and more if anyone's interested.

Would love feedback — what business/marketing skills would you want your agent to have?
